# Code Scanner

A simple Android application that scans QR codes and returns the scanned value. This project uses the ZXing library for QR code scanning and Jetpack Compose for the UI.

## Features
- Scan QR codes using the device camera.
- Display the value of the scanned QR code.

## Requirements
- Android Studio
- Kotlin 1.8 or higher
- Jetpack Compose
- Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher

## Dependencies
- [ZXing Android Embedded](https://github.com/journeyapps/zxing-android-embedded) - A powerful library for scanning QR codes on Android.
- [ZXing Core](https://github.com/zxing/zxing) - The core ZXing library for QR code scanning.

The following dependencies are included in the project:

```gradle
implementation "com.journeyapps:zxing-android-embedded:4.3.0"
implementation "com.google.zxing:core:3.4.1"
```

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/code-scanner.git
   ```

2. **Open the project in Android Studio**.

3. **Build the project** to download necessary dependencies.

4. **Run the app** on a physical device or emulator.

## Implementation Details

- **ZXing for QR Scanning**:
  The app uses the ZXing library to scan QR codes. The library integrates with the camera to detect and decode QR codes.

- **Jetpack Compose UI**:
  The UI is built using Jetpack Compose, the modern Android UI toolkit. It provides a declarative approach to building UIs with less boilerplate code.

## Usage

Once the app is launched, follow these steps:

1. **Grant Camera Permission**:
   When you run the app for the first time, you will be prompted to grant camera permissions.

2. **Scan a QR Code**:
   Point the camera towards a QR code. The app will automatically detect and scan it.

3. **View the Result**:
   The value of the scanned QR code will be displayed on the screen.

## Permissions

Make sure to include the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` to allow the app to access the device's camera:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus" />
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Camera not working**: Ensure that the app has the necessary camera permissions, and try restarting the app.
- **QR Code not detected**: Ensure that the QR code is clearly visible and within the camera's focus range.
